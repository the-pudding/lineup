But those rules are changing as baseball evolves, especially with analytics being used more to guide decisions. Those 1993 Blue Jays might not look the same in 2024."},{"type":"text","value":"We rated each player relative to the league on a 0-5 scale in four major categories: Hitting for average and power, walks and speed. Using those ratings, we grouped players by their lineup slot, and looked for the traits that each spot in the order had in common — and how that has changed over time. Those trends allowed us to then predict where a batter with a particular set of skills might tend to bat, depending on the era."},{"type":"text","value":"We put that concept to work by estimating how Toronto's old-school lineup order might change if they played today. Here's what our algorithm thinks might be the lineup for the hypothetical “2024” Toronto Blue Jays."},{"type":"text","value":"Because speed and batting average are less prioritized at leadoff, <span class=player>Tony Fernandez</span> has become Toronto’s most likely leadoff hitter. <span class=player>Henderson</span> and <span class=player>White</span> shift lower, as teams have been more willing to bat their better hitters deeper in the order in recent seasons."},{"type":"text","value":"<span class=player>Olerud</span> and <span class=player>Molitor</span> move up due to their all-around skills, and <span class=player>Alomar</span> becomes the centerpiece of the modern analytical lineup in the No. 2 hole."},{"type":"text","value":"And <span class=player>Carter</span>, who would likely be penciled in further down in the lineup, may never have gotten the chance to hit that iconic HR from the cleanup spot."}]},{"type":"text","value":"That’s just one example. Plenty of other teams and players would be known for different spots in the order if they plied their trade in today’s more analytically oriented era of baseball. So let’s run through the old and new rules for building a lineup, using players at each spot who best typified the types of skills managers were looking for in each role by era:"},{"type":"sections","value":[{"id":"1","title":"Batting 1st","text":[{"type":"text","value":"Managers used to prize speed at the top of the lineup over just about everything else. Leadoff hitters needed to get on base too — preferably by rapping out a single, because swinging-and-missing was taboo. But once a leadoff hitter was standing on first, they needed to be able to steal second even when the pitcher and catcher knew they were going to take off."},{"type":"text","value":"But nowadays, managers want slightly more power out of their leadoff hitters, and they’re willing to trade some speed for it. A few modern No. 1 hitters can do it all, stealing bases and hitting home runs in equal measure — <span class=player>Mookie Betts</span> of the Dodgers and <span class=player>Ronald Acuña Jr.</span> of the Braves are great examples of this — but they are rare talents. More commonly, you will see a player like <span class=player>Marcus Semien</span>, who gets on base with walks and hits with above-average power in addition to his decent running speed, penciled in atop the lineup."}]},{"id":"2","title":"Batting 2nd","text":[{"type":"text","value":"The classic No. 2 hitter is all about “bat control.” That might mean hitting for a solid average, as <span class=player>Ozzie Smith</span>, “The Wizard of Oz,” often did in his career. But it might also mean deliberately hitting the ball “behind the runner” to reduce the risk of a double play — or even to lay down a perfect sacrifice bunt. The important thing was to make sure the leadoff hitter got into scoring position for the big bats to drive in later. And a little speed from this spot never hurts, either, especially since it helps those ground balls turn into infield hits."},{"type":"text","value":"No place in the lineup showcases how the game has changed more than the No. 2 slot. Remember how the second spot in the order used to be all about making contact and moving runners over? Now, the <a href=https://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2009/3/17/795946/optimizing-your-lineup-by target=_blank>data say</a> that your best overall hitter should hit second more often — and not always third, as originally believed. At the No. 2 spot, they will come to the plate more often, and less frequently with two outs. This is why better overall hitters — and especially better power hitters, like <span class=player>Trout</span>, <span class=player>Seager</span> and <span class=player>Shohei Ohtani</span> — are hitting in the 2-hole than they ever did in the past."}]},{"id":"3","title":"Batting 3rd","text":[{"type":"text","value":"The No. 3 slot was traditionally reserved for the best hitter — or, more generally, the biggest star among batters — on the team. In the 3-hole, you were expected to hit for power and average, driving in the leadoff man if he was on base, or setting up the cleanup hitter for RBI chances of his own. It was a matter of pride for big names to bat in this slot."},{"type":"text","value":"However, as a result of research showing that top all-around hitters should bat second, the 3-hole has lost some of its prestige. Today’s No. 3 hitters are no slouches, of course. But as more players with a mix of elite skills get moved elsewhere, teams now tend to place greater focus on one particular attribute here, asking less of the role in terms of speed and other facets of the game."}]},{"id":"4","title":"Batting 4th","text":[{"type":"text","value":"Other than Leadoff, this is the only spot with its own nickname: the Cleanup Hitter. That’s because No. 4 hitters “clean up the bases” by slugging home the runners in front of them. Historically, power has always been the most important attribute in the cleanup spot, with on-base percentage taking on less significance because the job of slots 1-3 was to get on base and set the table for the cleanup hitter. Even strikeouts were more tolerated here, if it meant a trade-off for more power. And cleanup hitters didn’t traditionally need to be fast."},{"type":"text","value":"But the cleanup role is changing a lot recently. It’s still a place for some teams to put burly sluggers, to be sure, but the typical No. 4 hitter is now less powerful — and patient — than in the 1990s. (It’s also getting very slightly faster on average, weirdly enough.) In fact, no lineup slot has seen a bigger decline in <a href=https://library.fangraphs.com/offense/wrc/ target=_blank>Weighted Runs Created Plus</a> — a measure of batting effectiveness relative to league average — than the cleanup spot since then."}]},{"id":"5-7","title":"Batting 5th-7th","text":[{"type":"text","value":"Nos. 5-7 are where the lineup gets flexible, with managers often using those slots as lesser versions of the cleanup spot — perhaps featuring a power hitter with a poor batting average or a low walk rate. One traditional rule was also to alternate the handedness of these spots depending on which side of the plate the cleanup hitter batted from: So a lefty No. 4 hitter would be followed by a righty No. 5, a lefty No. 6 and so forth, to ensure that the opposing manager couldn’t neutralize an entire block of the lineup with one reliever late in games."},{"type":"text","value":"In the modern game, these slots have undergone a surprising evolution: From a place for plodding sluggers to a spot to stash speedsters! As power bats have begun to take over the leadoff slot, batters who would have been leadoff hitters in an earlier era are increasingly moving down the order — and they often get penciled in at Nos. 5-7 now."}]},{"id":"8-9","title":"Batting 8th-9th","text":[{"type":"text","value":"In an earlier era of the game, these lineup slots were defined by holding the worst hitters on the team. (Quite literally, back when National League pitchers hit — they would almost always hit ninth, with the only exception being when oddball managers like Joe Maddon or Tony La Russa <a href=https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/13004137/why-manager-joe-maddon-bats-pitcher-eighth-chicago-cubs-lineup target=_blank>batted the pitcher eighth</a>.) The best that could be said for them back then was that an 8-hole hitter in the NL would be a veteran who was OK with not getting many pitches to hit in front of the pitcher, or a No. 9 batter in the AL profiling as a “second leadoff hitter” coming up in front of the <i>actual</i> leadoff man."},{"type":"text","value":"But these spots are gaining ground on the rest of the lineup during the analytics era, even after accounting for the absence of hitting pitchers from the game nowadays. Already speedy, they’ve gotten faster (again, you have to stash the batters who formerly would have hit leadoff <i>somewhere</i>), and AL No. 9 hitters walk more than ever — another sign that modern managers are spreading their batting talent more evenly throughout the lineup."}]}]},{"type":"credits","value":[{"type":"text","value":"Written by <a href=https://pudding.cool/author/neil-paine/ target=_blank>Neil Paine</a>.

Those skill scores are what appear on the charts and player cards above."},{"type":"text","value":"Then, we put the skill scores in a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression target=_blank>logistic regression</a> model that attempted to predict the probability of a player with any given profile batting at each slot in the order. Those models were conducted on data from two different eras: The Sabermetrics Era of MLB (2010-present), when teams began the widespread use of analytics to help construct their lineups; and the Old-School Era (1970-2009), when teams still made decisions based on gut instinct and received wisdom."},{"type":"text","value":"With those regressions, we can see how a player with the exact same breakdown of skills might bat in two very different places in the order, depending on whether the manager was thinking about the traditional rules of lineup construction or basing their decisions on more analytics-driven research."}]}]}
